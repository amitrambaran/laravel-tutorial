        <p>Laravel includes many features that addresses the stigma around "messy" PHP code.
            We will learn how to use routes and design a clean and
            efficient form for the uesr to submit information.

            <p>Laravel makes it extremely easy for developers to create forms.
                After you have installed Laravel with the necessary dependancies, go
                ahead and create a 'contact.blade.php' file in /resources/views.

                One reason why Laravel is so popular is because it handles routing
                with ease. Go ahead and create controllers for your form in /routes/web.php.
                The first parameter is the URL used to acccess the page, and the second
                is the controller it will use. (Eg. /contact, uses => "Controller").
                A third field can also be used to specify an alias for the controller,
                as shown below as 'contact.store' for better readability.

        <div class="notification">
            <p>Go back to your contact.blade.php file. This is where the front end is done.
                Create your HTML boilerplate as usual, and then include the Bulma CDN link
                for CSS styling.

            <p>From here, you are now free to create your own HTML form as usual. The only difference
                is that you will wrap each form element with div tags, and include the respective
                Bulma class for that element. (eg. 'div class="field", div class="radio"', etc).

            <p>Making use of Laravel's MVC (Model View Controller) infrastructure, we can view what
                variables were submitted by surrounding your form elements with a routing action element
                as seen below. Here, the alias is used for better legibility. The csrf_field() method
                allows for you to see whether or not your variables have actually been saved.

            <p>Another advantage of Laravel is that it uses Composer, a dependancy manager for PHP.
                It also supports Artisan commands, making this process painfully easy and seamless.
                Open your command line (or Git Bash on Windows) within your project folder
                and run the following command:
                <br><br><code>$ php artisan make:controller ContactMessageController</code><br><br>

    <div class="container is-fluid">
        <div class="notification">
            <p> You will now notice that there is a ContactMessageController in /http/Controllers.
                This is where your controllers are stored. <br>
                *Note that this step can also be done with a text editor such as VSCode if
                configured properly.</p><br>

        <div class="notification">
            <p>We will now create the two main controllers for the routes we defined
                previously. The return view() method returns your main page (or view),
                and the dd() method dumps your submitted variables, and then dies
                (hence the name 'dd'). Insert the following code in your new
                ContactMessageController file.

            <p>By now, you should have noticed that all three attributes of the MVC Model
                have been satisfied. Go ahead and access your page via localhost/contact
                in your web browser.

            <p>Try filling in the fields of your form and clicking on your submit
                button. If done correctly, you should be able to see your variables
                mapped correctly. You can use these variables in any which way you
                like. Congratuations on creating your first webpage with Laravel!
